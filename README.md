# ðŸ¤– ML & Robotics Playground

> A collection of machine learning experiments focused on robotics and autonomous systems. Currently featuring [Zaptrack](https://zaptrack.us) that learns to drive from human demonstrations!

## Zaptrack Navigation Project

Built a self-driving farm robot using behavioral cloning (yeah, like what NVIDIA did, but smaller and cooler). The CNN takes raw camera input and spits out steering/throttle commands.
